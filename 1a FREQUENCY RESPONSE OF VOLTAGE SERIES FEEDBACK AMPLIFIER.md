## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | = 0.28Khz| =0.24Khz|
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = 1.4Mhz |  =2.7Mhz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl =1.39MHz\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l =2.6MHz \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 21\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 17.04\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 4.84 | 12.08 |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
